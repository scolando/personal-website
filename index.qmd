I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated this Spring from Pomona College, where I double majored in Mathematics and Philosophy.

Since Summer 2022, I have been heavily involved in biostatistics research in genomics -- investigating technical conditions that underlie ChIP-Seq normalization methods with [Jo Hardin](https://hardin47.netlify.app) at Pomona. I am also passionate about work at the intersection of statistics, data science, and philosophy, particularly related to data science ethics.
