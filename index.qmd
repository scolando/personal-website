Hi, and welcome to my website!

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated magna cum laude from Pomona College in Spring 2024 with a double major in Mathematics and Philosophy.

Since Summer 2022, I have been heavily involved in biostatistics research in genomics -- investigating technical conditions that underlie ChIP-Seq normalization methods with [Jo Hardin](https://hardin47.netlify.app) at Pomona. I am also passionate about work at the intersection of statistics, data science, and philosophy, particularly related to data science ethics. Find out more about my interests and past experiences by browsing the site.
