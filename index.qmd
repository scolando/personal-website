Hi, and welcome to my website!

I am a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I graduated *magna cum laude* from Pomona College in Spring 2024 with a double major in Mathematics and Philosophy.

This spring, I started my Advanced Data Analysis (ADA) project on predicting avoidance ties within social networks by leveraging features of the positive network between the same individuals and basic node-level covariates (e.g., sex and ethnicity) in collaboration with [Nynke Niezink](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~nynke/) and Eva Jaspers (Utrecht University). Additionally, I have been involved in genomics research -- investigating technical conditions that underlie ChIP-Seq normalization methods with [Jo Hardin](https://hardin47.netlify.app) since Summer 2022.

I am also passionate about work at the intersection of statistics, data science, and philosophy, particularly related to data science ethics and (social) epistemology. Find out more about my interests and past experiences by browsing the site.
