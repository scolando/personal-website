    "title": "Selecting ChIP-Seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview: Within the last two decades, high throughput sequencing has become one of the most popular methods for data generation within genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. A popular method of high throughput sequencing is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing, or ChIP-Seq. ChIP-Seq data provides vital insights into locations on the genome where there are differences in DNA occupancy between experimental states (i.e., differential DNA occupancy). However, since ChIP-Seq data is collected experimentally, it must be normalized to assess which genomic regions have differential DNA occupancy. While normalization is an essential step in identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy, the primary technical conditions underlying ChIP-Seq normalization methods have yet to be specifically examined in the academic literature. In this thesis, we identify three primary technical conditions underlying ChIP-Seq between-sample normalization methods: (1) Symmetric Differential DNA Occupancy, (2) Equal Amount of Total DNA Occupancy across Experimental States, and (3) Equal Amount of Total Background Binding across Experimental States. We then categorize commonly-used ChIP-Seq normalization methods based on the technical conditions they use to normalize between experimental states. A major contribution of this thesis is our ChIP-Seq read count simulation results, which validate our categorization of the normalization methods by their technical conditions. We conclude by underscoring how our findings demonstrate that not all normalization methods are equally effective on all kinds of ChIP-Seq data. Rather, researchers should use their understanding of the ChIP-Seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of normalization method when possible or try mulitiple between-sample ChIP-Seq normalization methods to create a ‘high-confidence’ peakset which contains peaks that are less sensitive to one’s choice of normalization method.\n\nSenior Thesis PDF on Selecting ChIP-Seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions, advised by Jo Hardin.\n\nFunded by Pomona College’s The Class of 1971 Summer Undergraduate Research Fund (Summer 2022) and the Kenneth Cooke Summer Research Fellowship (Summer 2024)."

There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethical topics. The ethical topics were collated from sixteen data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which is rife with potentially morally charged decision points.\n\nColando, S., & Hardin, J.

    "text": "Download PDF file.\nImagine that there is a recidivism algorithm being used to determine if an incarcerated man should be granted early parole release. This algorithm has the bias that ‘Black men are more likely to be reconvicted than white men.’ Suppose that this algorithmic bias is statistically accurate; it is, in fact, more likely for Black men to be reconvicted than white men. Still, the algorithm’s disposition to predict that a Black man is more likely to be reconvicted than a white man seems morally problematic. However, could the algorithmic bias (which leads to its morally flawed disposition) also be epistemically flawed, even though it is statistically accurate? In this paper, I elucidate how a bias’s etiology, i.e., the means that give rise to a bias, can influence the epistemic evaluation of an algorithmic bias. In particular, I argue that biases that arise through gerrymandered means in endorsed algorithms are epistemically flawed in virtue of being gerrymandered and endorsed. I begin by explaining what I mean by bias and vindicating that algorithms can have biases. I next adopt philosopher Jessie Munton’s argument that gerrymandered perceptual priors are inherently epistemically flawed in order to offer a sufficient condition for gerrymandered biases and underscore a primary epistemic aim of predictive skill. Using my adopted version of Munton’s argument, I contend that gerrymandered biases in endorsed algorithms increase the likelihood of inaccurate modal predictions, thereby reducing the predictive skill of agents whose decisions are influenced by the algorithm. Such a reduction in predictive skill diminishes one’s ability to gain causal-explanatory knowledge about relevant environments, which is epistemically problematic. Thus, I conclude that gerrymandered biases in endorsed algorithms are epistemically flawed in virtue of being gerrymandered and endorsed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "On Calibration Within Groups being Necessary for Algorithmic Fairness",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Download PDF file.\nAs algorithms have become more ubiquitous in decisions with high moral stakes – like deciding who to approve for a loan, who to release early on parole, and which communities to give additional governmental resources to – there has also been a growing concern about what is required for such algorithms to be fair. One criterion that is commonly viewed as necessary for algorithmic fairness within computer science circles is calibration within groups. Per calibration within groups, an algorithm is fair only if for every risk score s and group A, s percent of the individuals in group A who are assigned a risk score s are indeed positive instances. However, in this paper, I argue that calibration within groups is not always necessary for algorithmic fairness, even when it is most charitably conceived. I begin with a primer on algorithmic fairness and then further explain what is meant by calibration within groups. I next explicate Brian Hedden and Robert Long’s positive arguments for why calibration within groups is necessary for algorithmic fairness. I then delve into critiques of such arguments. These critiques lead me to present a modified conception of calibration within groups, which I contend is maximally charitable. Yet, I present a case to demonstrate how an algorithm can violate even the maximally charitable conception of calibration within groups but still fail to be intuitively unfair in virtue of doing so. Thus, I conclude that calibration within groups, even when it is most charitably conceived, is not always necessary for algorithmic fairness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
