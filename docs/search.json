    "title": "Selecting ChIP-Seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview: Within the last two decades, high throughput sequencing has become one of the most popular methods for data generation within genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics. A popular method of high throughput sequencing is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing, or ChIP-Seq. ChIP-Seq data provides vital insights into locations on the genome where there are differences in DNA occupancy between experimental states (i.e., differential DNA occupancy). However, since ChIP-Seq data is collected experimentally, it must be normalized to assess which genomic regions have differential DNA occupancy. While normalization is an essential step in identifying genomic regions with differential DNA occupancy, the primary technical conditions underlying ChIP-Seq normalization methods have yet to be specifically examined in the academic literature. In this thesis, we identify three primary technical conditions underlying ChIP-Seq between-sample normalization methods: (1) Symmetric Differential DNA Occupancy, (2) Equal Amount of Total DNA Occupancy across Experimental States, and (3) Equal Amount of Total Background Binding across Experimental States. We then categorize commonly-used ChIP-Seq normalization methods based on the technical conditions they use to normalize between experimental states. A major contribution of this thesis is our ChIP-Seq read count simulation results, which validate our categorization of the normalization methods by their technical conditions. We conclude by underscoring how our findings demonstrate that not all normalization methods are equally effective on all kinds of ChIP-Seq data. Rather, researchers should use their understanding of the ChIP-Seq experiment at hand to guide their choice of normalization method when possible or try mulitiple between-sample ChIP-Seq normalization methods to create a ‘high-confidence’ peakset which contains peaks that are less sensitive to one’s choice of normalization method.\n\nSenior Thesis PDF on Selecting ChIP-Seq Normalization Methods from the Perspective of their Technical Conditions, advised by Jo Hardin.\n\nFunded by Pomona College’s The Class of 1971 Summer Undergraduate Research Fund (Summer 2022) and the Kenneth Cooke Summer Research Fellowship (Summer 2024)."

There are not always, however, explicit connections between data science ethics and the centuries-old work on ethics within the discipline of philosophy. Here, we present a framework for bringing together key data science practices with ethical topics. The ethical topics were collated from sixteen data science ethics courses with public-facing syllabi and reading lists. We encourage individuals who are teaching data science ethics to engage with the philosophical literature and its connection to current data science practices, which is rife with potentially morally charged decision points.\n\nColando, S., & Hardin, J.

    "text": "Download PDF file.\nImagine that there is a recidivism algorithm being used to determine if an incarcerated man should be granted early parole release. This algorithm has the bias that ‘Black men are more likely to be reconvicted than white men.’ Suppose that this algorithmic bias is statistically accurate; it is, in fact, more likely for Black men to be reconvicted than white men. Still, the algorithm’s disposition to predict that a Black man is more likely to be reconvicted than a white man seems morally problematic. However, could the algorithmic bias (which leads to its morally flawed disposition) also be epistemically flawed, even though it is statistically accurate? In this paper, I elucidate how a bias’s etiology, i.e., the means that give rise to a bias, can influence the epistemic evaluation of an algorithmic bias. In particular, I argue that biases that arise through gerrymandered means in endorsed algorithms are epistemically flawed in virtue of being gerrymandered and endorsed. I begin by explaining what I mean by bias and vindicating that algorithms can have biases. I next adopt philosopher Jessie Munton’s argument that gerrymandered perceptual priors are inherently epistemically flawed in order to offer a sufficient condition for gerrymandered biases and underscore a primary epistemic aim of predictive skill. Using my adopted version of Munton’s argument, I contend that gerrymandered biases in endorsed algorithms increase the likelihood of inaccurate modal predictions, thereby reducing the predictive skill of agents whose decisions are influenced by the algorithm. Such a reduction in predictive skill diminishes one’s ability to gain causal-explanatory knowledge about relevant environments, which is epistemically problematic. Thus, I conclude that gerrymandered biases in endorsed algorithms are epistemically flawed in virtue of being gerrymandered and endorsed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "On Calibration Within Groups being Necessary for Algorithmic Fairness",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Download PDF file.\nAs algorithms have become more ubiquitous in decisions with high moral stakes – like deciding who to approve for a loan, who to release early on parole, and which communities to give additional governmental resources to – there has also been a growing concern about what is required for such algorithms to be fair. One criterion that is commonly viewed as necessary for algorithmic fairness within computer science circles is calibration within groups. Per calibration within groups, an algorithm is fair only if for every risk score s and group A, s percent of the individuals in group A who are assigned a risk score s are indeed positive instances. However, in this paper, I argue that calibration within groups is not always necessary for algorithmic fairness, even when it is most charitably conceived. I begin with a primer on algorithmic fairness and then further explain what is meant by calibration within groups. I next explicate Brian Hedden and Robert Long’s positive arguments for why calibration within groups is necessary for algorithmic fairness. I then delve into critiques of such arguments. These critiques lead me to present a modified conception of calibration within groups, which I contend is maximally charitable. Yet, I present a case to demonstrate how an algorithm can violate even the maximally charitable conception of calibration within groups but still fail to be intuitively unfair in virtue of doing so. Thus, I conclude that calibration within groups, even when it is most charitably conceived, is not always necessary for algorithmic fairness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview: Between 2009 and 2021, over 7,200 horses died or were euthanized due to racing-related injuries. Using horse profile data and horse tracking data from the NYRA, we hoped to identify horses who under-raced between 2019 and 2021, cluster movement profiles for horses who raced in 2019 New York races, and discover whether certain profiles were more associated with injured horses.\nBy fitting a negative binomial model on horse profile data and performing residual analysis, we discovered that at least 251 horses under-raced between 2019 and 2021. Additionally, clustering horse movement profiles revealed that a horse’s speed profile is most associated with its injury status: specifically, greater variation in speed is more associated with injury.\nDone in through Carnegie Mellon’s Sports Analytics Camp and via an external partnership with Joseph Appelbaum at the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview: Radiologists segment tumors from MRI scans to determine treatment plans such as surgical resection or radiation therapy, whereas neural networks can streamline the segmentation process to ensure ideal tumor removal and reduce the burden on radiologists. However, these black-box models currently lack explainability, which leads to a lack of trust from different end users like physicians and patients when used to segment brain tumors. Uncertainty Quantification communicates to stakeholders: (a) if and when they should trust model predictions and (b) how fair these predictions are on sample-wide and patient-specific cases. Therefore, Uncertainty Quantification enhances a model’s transparency by exposing a model’s properties to various stakeholders to better understand, improve, and contest the model’s predictions. In this project, we aim to quantify model uncertainty by using a partially Bayesian neural network to communicate where the model is uncertain of its prediction of a pixel being classified as “tumor” or “non-tumor.” In particular, we aim to address the following questions:\n\nWhere is this model failing, and how is it failing to properly segment the tumor?\nIn what cases is the model certain but still making mistakes in tumor segmentation?\n\nUltimately, we find that the highest uncertainty is at the boundary regions of the model’s predicted tumor location and the false negative and false positive pixels are highly clustered. Further, we discover that there is generally higher certainty for accurately classified pixels as well as greater certainty for false negatives than false positives pixels. From our findings, we suggest future work in collaboration with clinicians to better understand why model fails in specific brain regions, and why false positive and false negative results tend to cluster. Moreover, we suggest that the model performance and uncertainty levels across should be compared various subsets (e.g., different tumor histologies, tissue source sites, patient sex, vital status, etc.) to investigate whether there are trends in differential model performance across different demographic groups.\n\nSummer 2022 Poster PDF on quantifying uncertainty in a tumor segmentation model.\nSummer 2022 Presentation PDF on quantifying uncertainty in a tumor segmentation model\n\nDone through University of Michigan School of Public Health’s Big Data Summer Institute and via a partnership with Dr. Nikola Banovic and Snehal Prabhudesai in University of Michigan School of Computer Science and Engineering."

    "text": "Figure 1: A slightly cynical perspective on algorithmicfairness metrics from Machines Gone Wrong.\nAlgorithms are becoming an increasingly ubiquitous component of decision-making with high moral stakes, such as loan and mortgage approval, governmental aid allocations, health insurance claim approval, and US bail and sentencing procedures. With the growing use of algorithms in settings with high moral stakes, there has also been a growing concern about algorithmic fairness, or more specifically, whether an algorithm used to make decisions in such settings is (un)fair.\nMany statistical metrics have been developed to assess whether a given algorithm is (un)fair. Since 2022, I have been interested in these measures and how they track with discussions of fairness and justice coming from Philosophy – a field which has been theorizing about fairness and justice for more than two millennia. However, when doing research on statistical metrics of fairness, I realized that the definitions of such metrics tend to be scattered across multiple papers, making it difficult to understand how different metrics compare (or motivate) one another.\nIn this notebook, I provide an overview of common algorithmic fairness metrics coming from Statistics and draw comparison between the described metrics. For simplicity, I focus on outcome-based measures of fairness (i.e., metrics that evaluate an algorithm for fairness using its outputted predictions), though, I hope to delve into more procedural-based fairness measures sometime in the future. Additionally, since many of the common fairness metrics are for discrete prediction problems, I primarily focus on those metrics in this notebook rather than fairness metrics for continuous prediction problems."

    "text": "Some Key Terms\n\nTrue Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives\n\n\n\n\nDiagram from Analytics Vidhya.\n\n\n\nMost fairness metrics for discrete prediction algorithms use some combination of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives in their calculations. A helpful way of visualizing the difference between terms is through a confusion matrix (like the one depicted for a binary prediction algorithm on the left). Notice how true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives all rely on comparing an observation’s predicted class to its true (or actual) class. Specifically, a true positive (TP) is when observation’s true class and predicted class are both positive, and a false positive (FP) is when the observation’s true class is positive but its predicted class is not. On the other hand, a true negative (TN) is when observation’s true class and predicted class are both negative, and a false negative (FN) is when the observation’s true class is positive but its predicted class is not.\nAn Real-World Example: The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) algorithm is used in US courtrooms to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist (i.e. being re-convicted) by assigning each defendant a score between 1-10 based on their predicted likelihood of recidivism. A defendant is considered to have a low risk of recidivism if their COMPAS score is between 1-4 and medium to high risk of recidivism if their COMPAS score is between 5-10. In ProPublica’s seminal analysis of COMPAS, true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives are defined as follows:1\n\nA true positive is when a defendant receives a COMPAS score between 5-10 and is re-convicted in the two years after they were scored.\nA false positive is when a defendant receives a COMPAS score between 5-10 but is not re-convicted in the two years after they were scored.\nA true negative is when a defendant receives a COMPAS score between 1-4 and is not re-convicted in the two years after they were scored.\nA false negative is when a defendant receives a COMPAS score between 1-4 but is re-convicted in the two years after they were scored.\n\n\n\nConditional Probability\nAnother important term to understand when talking about statistical fairness metrics is conditional probability which is the probability of an event some other event occurs. Let A and B be two events, where B has a non-zero probability of occurring, then the conditional probability of A given B (i.e. \\(\\mathbb{P}(A|B)\\)) can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\\mathbb{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(A\\cap B)}{\\mathbb{P}(B)}\\]\nIn real-life, we rarely know the true probability of events occurring. Instead, one can estimate this probability empirically using the sample estimate of the probability. That is, one can find the proportion of times that both event A and event B occurred out of the total number of times event B occurred within the sample."

For example, why separate low from medium to high risk of recidivism at 4-5 rather than 3-4 or 5-6?↩︎\nYou might notice that in this notebook, I interpret each fairness metric as a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition of algorithm fairness, meaning that an algorithm would be considered unfair if it does not satisfy X metric necessary for algorithmic fairness but it would not necessarily be fair if it does satisfy the required metric. This, in my opinion, is the most charitable way of interpreting the common statistical fairness metrics that I discuss in this notebook.↩︎"
